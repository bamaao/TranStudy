## 6. Witnesses
## 6.见证人

Looking for a “reality test”, observe that some of the participants of our network are non-anonymous reputable people or companies who might have a long established reputation, or they are businesses interested in keeping the network healthy.   
寻找“真实测试”时，发现我们网络中的一些参与者是非匿名的信誉良好的人或可能具有长期声誉的公司，或者他们是对保持网络健康感兴趣的企业。  

We’ll call them witnesses.
我们称他们为见证人。   

While it is reasonable to expect them to behave honestly, it is also unreasonable to totally trust any single witness.   
当希望他们表现出诚实行为的同时，完全相信任何一个见证人也是不合理的。  

If we know the Byteball addresses of several witnesses, and also expect them to post frequently enough, then to measure the reality of a candidate MC one might travel along the MC back in time and count the witness-authored units (if the same witness is encountered more than once, he is not counted again).   
如果我们知道几个见证人的雪球地址，也期待他们足够频繁地发布单元，然后去衡量候选主链的真实性，可以及时沿着主链回退，数出见证人授权的单元（如果相同的见证人相遇不止一次，他就不会再被计数了）。

We would stop traveling as soon as we had encountered the majority of witnesses.   
一旦我们遇到大量的见证人，我们将停止回退。  

We would then measure the length of the longest path on the graph from the point at which we stopped to the genesis.  
之后我们将测量从我们停下来的单元到创世单元在图中最长路径的长度。   

We’ll call this length the level of the unit where we stopped, and the witnessed level of the parent whose MC we are testing.   
我们将这个长度称为我们停止的单元的级别和我们正在测试的主链的父辈单元的见证级别。

The candidate MC that yields the greater witnessed level is considered more “real”, and the parent bearing this MC is selected as best parent.   
产生更高见证级别的候选主链被认为是更“真实的”，带有该主链的父辈单元被选为最优父辈单元。  

In case there are several contenders with a maximum witnessed level, we would select the parent whose own level is the lowest.   
如果有几个具有最大见证级别的竞争者，我们会选择具有最低级别的父级单元。  

If the tie persists, we would select the parent with the smallest unit hash (in base64 encoding).  
如果仍然是平局，我们将选择拥有最小单元哈希值的父辈（使用base64编码）。

This algorithm allows the selection of the MC that gravitates to units authored by witnesses, and the witnesses are considered to be representative of reality.   
该算法允许选择被见证人授权的单元所在的主链，并且见证人被认为是真实的代表。   
 
If, for example, an attacker forks from the honest part of the network and secretly builds a long chain of his own units (shadow chain), one of them containing a double-spend, and later merges his fork back into the honest DAG, the best parent selection algorithm at the merger point will choose the parent that drives the MC into the honest DAG, as this is where the witnesses were active.   

例如，如果攻击者从网络诚实单元处分叉，并且秘密地创建一条他自己的单元的长链（影子链），他们中的一个包含双花，之后分叉的单元又合并回诚实的DAG中，在合并点的最优父辈单元选择算法将选出将主链趋向诚实DAG的父辈单元，因为这是见证人活跃的位置。

The witnesses were not able to post into the shadow chain simply because they didn’t see it before the merger.   
见证人不能仅仅因为在合并之前没有看到它而进入影子链。  

This selection of MC reflects the order of events as seen by the witnesses and the user who appointed them.   
主链的选择影响了见证人和指定他们的用户所看到的事件的顺序。  

After the attack is over, the entire shadow chain will land on the MC at one point, and the double-spend contained in the shadow chain will be deemed invalid because its valid counterpart comes earlier, before the merger point.
在攻击结束之后，整个影子链将在一点处连到主链上，被包含在影子链中的双花将被认为是无效的，因为它的有效对应部分在合并点之前出现。

>Figure 4. When an attacker rejoins his shadow DAG into the lit DAG, his units lose competition to become best parent as the choice favors those paths that have more witnesses (marked with w).  

>图4. 当攻击者将他的影子DAG重新加入到诚实的DAG中时，他的单元将失去成为最优父辈单元的竞争力，同时选择支持那些拥有更多见证人的路径（标有w）。

This example shows why the majority of witnesses has to be trusted to post only serially.   
这个例子表明了大多数被信任的见证人只能连续发布单元。  

The majority should not collude with the attacker and post on his shadow chain.   
大多数见证人不应该与攻击者勾结并在他的影子链上发布单元。  

Note that we trust the witnesses only to be signs of reality and to not post nonserial units on any shadow chains.   
注意，我们相信见证人仅仅是真实的标志并且没有在任何影子链上发布单元。  

We are not giving any of them control over the network or any part thereof. 
我们不会让任何人控制网络或其任何部分。  

Even for this small duty, it is users who appoint the witnesses and they can change their decisions at any time.  
即使对于这个小职责，也是指定见证人的用户，他们可以随时改变他们的决定。

The idea of looking at some known entity as a sign of reality is not new.   
将一些已知实体视为事实的标志的想法并不新鲜。

It has long been known, and some companies have engaged in such activity, that to prove that some data existed before a specific date, one can hash the data and publish the hash in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed newspaper [6].  
人们早就知道，并且一些公司已经参与了这样的活动，为了证明某些数据在特定日期之前存在，人们可以对数据进行哈希运算并在一些难以修改和广泛被见证的媒体中发布哈希值，如印刷，报纸[6]。

Witnesses in Byteball serve the same function as the newspaper. 
在雪球中的见证人具有与报纸同样的功能。    

Like newspapers, they are well known and trusted.   
像报纸一样，他们是广为人知的也是值得信任的。

As for newspapers where trust is limited to trusting them to publish the data they are given, witnesses in Byteball are only trusted to post serially, and not much more.  
对于那些仅限于信任发布他们已知数据的报纸，在雪球中的见证人仅仅信任连续发布的单元，而且没有很多。   

Like newspapers, witnesses don’t know what’s behind the hashes they are witnessing and have few reasons to care.   
像报纸一样，见证人不知道他们所见证单元的哈希值并且没有理由去在意这个问题。


Newspapers are hard to modify (but possible, and in 1984 they do it), while everything produced by witnesses is protected by digital signatures, which makes any modifications impossible.   
报纸很难去修改（但是是可能的，在1984年他们做到了），而由证人产生的一切都受到数字签名的保护，这使得任何修改都不可能。  

For reliability, we have several witnesses, not just one, and for speed and convenience, these are online.  
为了可靠性，我们有几个见证人，不止一个，为了速度和便利，他们都是在线的。

Having decided on a list of witnesses, we can then select best the parent and the corresponding history that best fits the definition of reality as “somewhere where these witnesses live”.  
已经决定见证人名单，之后，我们可以选择最优父辈和与像“这些见证人住在哪”的现实定义相符的历史单元。

At the same time, the parents themselves might have different witness lists and consequently different definitions of reality.   
与此同时，父辈本身可能有不同的见证人列表，因此，对真实有不同的定义。  

We want the definitions of reality, and histories that follow from them, to converge around something common.   
我们需要真实的定义，跟随他们的历史单元，来围绕一些共同的事物汇聚。

To achieve this, we introduce the following additional protocol rule.
为了实现这个，我们介绍以下额外的协议规则。


The “near-conformity rule”: best parents must be selected only among those parents whose witness list differs from the child’s witness list by no more than one mutation.   
“近乎一致的规则”：最优父辈必须只在那些与见证人列表不同于孩子见证人且超过一个变化的父辈中选择。

This rule ensures that witness lists of neighboring units on the MC are similar enough, therefore their histories mostly agree with one another.   
这条规则确保见证人列表中在主链上的邻居单元足够相似，因此，他们历史单元大多数都认同另一个单元。

The parents whose witness list differs by 0 or 1 mutation will be called compatible (with the unit that includes them directly), while the others are incompatible.   
见证人列表变化为0或1的父辈单元将被称为是兼容的（与直接包括他们的单元），而其他单元是不兼容的。

Incompatible parents are still permitted, but they have no chance of becoming best parent.   
不兼容的父辈仍然被承认，但是他们没有机会成为最优父辈。

If there are no compatible potential parents among childless units (an attacker could flood the network with his units that carry a radically different witness list), one should select parents from older units.  
如果在没有后代的单元中没有兼容性的父辈（攻击者可能会将他的单元引入一个完全不同的证人名单），那么应该从较老的单元中选择父辈。


The above means that each unit must list its witnesses so that they can be compared.   
以上意味着每一个单元必须列出他的见证人以便于他们能被比较。

We require that the number of witnesses is exactly 12. 
我们需要见证人人数正好是12.

This number 12 was selected because:  
选择12是因为：

• it is sufficiently large to protect against the occasional failures of a few witnesses (they might prove dishonest, or be hacked, or go offline for a long time, or lose their private keys and go offline forever);
• 它是足够大的，可以防止少数证人的偶然失败（他们可能被证明是不诚实的，被黑，或长时间离线，或丢失私钥并永远离线）；

• it is sufficiently small that humans can keep track of all the witnesses to know who is who and change the list when necessary;  
• 它是足够小的，保证人们保持追踪所有见证人，知道谁是谁并且在必要的时候可以改变列表；

• the one allowed mutation is sufficiently small compared with the 11 unchanged witnesses.  
• 与11名未改变的见证人相比，一个改变是足够小的。

In case a user thinks that any of the witnesses has lost his credibility, or there are just better candidates, the user can replace the witness with a new witness in his list, bearing in mind that his witness list may not differ from that of other units by more than one position.   
如果用户认为任何见证人失去了信誉，或者有更好的候选人，用户可以用他的列表中的新见证人代替原来的见证人，请记住，他的见证人名单可能不止一个位置与其他单元的名单不同。

This means that any changes can happen only gradually, and a general consensus is required for a change bigger than one position.
这意味着任何变化只能逐渐发生，并且对于多于一个位置的变化需要达成普遍共识。
