## 8. Storage of nonserial units
## 8. 存储非连续单元

When we decide that	a unit	is a nonserial, we still	have to store it.	
当我们认为一个单元是不连续的，我们仍然需要存储它。

However, part	of its	data is replaced	with a hash	of the	data.    
然而，它的部分数据辈数据的哈希值代替。

This rule serves	two purposes.
这条规则有两个目的。

First,	to reduce	storage consumed by	a unit that nobody	paid for (the entire content of the nonserial unit	is	deemed	invalid, including its payment of commissions).  
第一，减少没有人支付的单位所消耗的存储量（非串行单元的全部内容被认为无效，包括支付佣金）。

Second, to reduce the utility	of the nonserial to the user who sent it, because the hash replaces all useful data that the author wanted to store (for free).		
第二，为了减少非连续单元给发送它的用户的存储效率，因为散列取代了发布者想要存储的所有有用数据（免费）。

This prevents attackers from abusing nonserials as a way to store large amounts of data for free.
这可以防止攻击者滥用非连续单元作为免费存储大量数据的方式。


The hash that is stored instead of the full content still has some utility to the attacker, as he can store the original data himself and use the hash to prove that the data existed.		  
存储的哈希值代替完整内容对攻击者仍然有用，因为他能存储他自己的原始数据并使用哈希值来证明数据存在。

But	remember that:
但是记住：

1. He still has to pay for one unit that is deemed valid
1. 他仍然不得不为一个被认为是有效的单元支付手续费。

2. If the attacker is already internally storing metadata that is necessary to interpret Byteball data, he could do equally well by just combining all his data into a Merkle tree and using Byteball to store only its Merkle root for the cost of one small unit.  
2. 如果攻击者已经在内部存储解释字节球数据所必需的元数据，那么他可以通过将所有的数据组合成Melkle树，并使用字节雪球来存储MelKel的根用于存储一个小单元的成本，这同样可以做得很好。


Under this design, there is therefore no self-interest in trying to send nonserials.  
因此，在这种设计中，尝试发送非连续的单元是没有私利的。

It ought to be mentioned that we cannot just reject nonserials the first time we see them.   
应该提到的是，我们第一次看到非连续单元就不能拒绝。

If we did, an attacker could send his nonserials to different users in different order.	  
如果我们这么做了，攻击者可能以不同的顺序发送他的非连续单元给不同的用户。

Different users would then stick to the versions they first received and reject everything based on the other version, so the attacker would succeed in partitioning the network.  
然后，不同的用户会坚持他们最初收到的版本，并拒绝所有基于其他版本的内容，因此攻击者将成功分割网络。

That’s why we have to store both versions and then decide on their order.  
这就是为什么我们必须存储两个版本，然后决定他们的顺序。

Even more, users should forward nonserials to peers just like any other	units, as the sooner peers learn about the nonserials the better.  
更重要的是，用户应该像任何其他单元一样将非连续的单元转发给同级的单元，因为越接近同级的单元就越了解非连续单元。

We still try to avoid including nonserials if possible: the parent selection algorithm excludes nonserials as long as they are childless.  
如果可能的话，我们仍然尝试避免包括非连续单元：父辈选择算法不包括非连续单元，只要它们是无子女的单元都不包括在内。

For this reason,	it’s desirable to help peers learn about nonserials as soon as possible.  
出于这个原因，最好是帮助同级的单元尽快了解非连续单元。
