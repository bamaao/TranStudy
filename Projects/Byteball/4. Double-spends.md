## 4. Double-Spends

## 4.双花

If a user tries to spend the same output twice, there are two possible situations:  
如果一个用户两次尝试花费相同的输出，有两种可能的解决方案：  

1. There is partial order between the two units that try to spend the same output, i.e. one of the units (directly or indirectly) includes the other unit, and therefore comes after it.   
两个尝试花费相同输出的单元之间存在偏序，即，其中一个单元（直接或间接地）包括另一个单元，因此被包含的单元会跟在后面尝试花费输出。  

  In this case, it is obvious that we can safely reject the later unit.  
  在这种情况下，显然，我们可以安全地拒绝后面的单元。  

2. There is no partial order between them. In this case, we accept both.    
它们之间没有偏序。在这种情况下，我们两个单元都接受。  

  We establish a total order between the units later on, when they are buried deep enough under newer units (see below how we do it).  
  当这些单元被深埋在新单元之下时（参见下面我们是怎么做的），我们在它们之间建立一个全序关系。  

  The one that appears earlier on the total order is deemed valid, while the other is deemed invalid.  
  在全序中较早出现的被认为是有效的，而另一个被视为无效。  


There is one more protocol rule that simplifies the definition of total order.  
有一个协议规则简化了全序的定义。   

We require, that if the same address posts more than one unit, it should include (directly or indirectly) all its previous units in every subsequent unit, i.e. there should be partial order between consecutive units from the same address. 
如果相同地址发布多于一个单元，它在每一个后续单元中应该（直接地或间接地）包括所有它之前的单元，即，在同一地址的连续单元中应该有一个偏序。  

In other words, all units from the same author should be serial.  
换句话说，所有来自同一个发起者的单元应该是连续的。  

If someone breaks this rule and posts two units such that there is no partial order between them (nonserial units), the two units are treated like double-spends even if they don’t try to spend the same output.   
如果某人打破了这条规则并且发布了两个在它们之间没有偏序的单元（不连续单元），这两个单元被认为是双花，即使它们没有尝试花费相同的输出。  

Such nonserials are handled as described in situation 2 above.  
这样不连续的单元按照上面的情况2处理。

图2.双花 彼此之间没有偏序。


If a user follows this rule but still tries to spend the same output twice, the double-spends become unambiguously ordered and we can safely reject the later one as in situation 1 above.   
如果一个用户遵循这个规定但仍然尝试花相同的输出两次，双花变得明确有序，并且我们可以安全地拒绝拒绝后面的单元，像上面的情况1。  

The double-spends that are not nonserials at the same time are hence easily filtered out.  
因此，在同一时间不是连续的双花很容易被过滤出来。


This rule is in fact quite natural.  
事实上，这条规则是很自然的。

When a user composes a new unit, he selects the most recent other units as parents of his unit.   
当用户组成一个新的单元，它选择最近的其它单元作为它的父单元。  

By putting them on his parents list, he declares his picture of the world, which implies that he has seen these units.   
通过把它们列到它的父辈清单，它向世界宣布了它的构图，这暗示了它已经看到了这些单元。  

He has therefore seen all parents of parents, parents of parents of parents, etc up until the genesis unit.   
因此，它已经看到了所有父辈的父辈，父辈的父辈的父辈，直到创世单元。  

This huge set should obviously include everything that he himself has produced, and therefore has seen.
这个巨大的集合应该显然包含了它自己产生的一切，因此已经看到了。

By not including a unit (even indirectly, through parents) the user denies that he has seen it.   
通过不包括一个单元（甚至间接地通过父母），用户否认它已经看到它。  

If we see that by not including his own previous unit a user denies having seen it, we’d say it’s odd, something fishy is going on.   
如果我们看到用户否认看见它，通过不包含包括它自己和它之前的单元，我们会认为这是奇怪的，可疑的事情正在发生。

We discourage such behavior.  
我们会阻止这种行为。
